# ET-3400
My version of the classic DIY microcomputer learning project.
This is a Great little project , the manual is very well done, tried the programs in manual and they were fun to experiment with.
I kept the original decoding and still no really understand it, the memory decoding could have been done with 2 chips.
Removed the cap in parallel with the crystal to have a perfect 1mhz clk.
Install 47 ohm resistors in series with the clk signal for a square signal.
Used a 16 x 8 sram for the memory and an AT28C64 for the ROM otherwise the rest is as per the original drawings.
The programming is very cleaver. the use of subroutines for the user to call up for his or her experiments.
The use of 74ls259 register ics for the 7 segment displays is a great and original idea. the programs cycles(rotates) through each FF(segment)  for each display, in the register till loaded.
